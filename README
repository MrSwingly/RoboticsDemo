ConfigAndPlanningDemo
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Demo is meant to show the config and planning modules. You may design a maze with the following constraints
    1) All walls must be within the white boundaries
    2) All walls must be vertical or horizontal (diagnal walls cause issues with configspace generation)
    3) Hippo and Hound must both be put inside the box
To create the maze, click on the one of varying wall sizes on the right, then copy (Ctrl-C) and paste (Ctrl-V) to 
make a copy of the desired Wall. Afterwards, use the arrows to rotate and move the wall to the desired location.
Next be sure to put hound and hippo into the maze by clicking on them and dragging them into the maze. For this demo 
they simply act as place holders so they will no be doing anything. You may create whatever maze satisifies the three 
constraints, but keep in mind that if the maze is unsolvable RRT will run until it hits the upper boundary on node values.

Next, click File in the top left corner to open drop-down menu, select Open Text File and open the following file
HHHDemo/controllers/hawk_config_plan/planner.py
The file should now be open in the text editor in Webots. Interactive part is located between ###### barriers.
